            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Theme Analytics LLC: Quantitative Research Intern, Jan 2024 – Apr 2024</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed trading strategies to be used by PMs by leveraging time-series prediction, and conducted back tests to report the Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and annualized return. </li>
                <li>Developed a liquidity prediction model with 94% accuracy to forecast the most liquid symbols in the market for a given month. Led to more efficient use of storage, computation, and data acquisition costs. </li>
                <li>Analyzed ETF trading strategies to evaluate exposure to underlying stocks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>University of Toronto: Data Science Research Fellow, May 2023 – Apr 2024</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Researched and implemented deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for derivative pricing and hedging. In more than 80% of cases, DRL based hedging portfolio can outperform a Delta strategy in real world options markets.</li>
                <li>Met weekly with a financial institution to provide comprehensive and insightful reports, highlight key findings, potential risks, and discuss future directions for AI derivative pricing.</li>
                <li>Leveraged large language models to produce multiple literature reviews and document summaries.  </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Dalhousie University: Data Management Lead, May 2021 – Sep 2022</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a program in R to download autogenerated and up to date PDF reports from Shiny applications. Adopted and used by the CDC in their SARS-CoV-2 wastewater epidemiology data dashboard. </li>
                <li>Programmed a cloud storage sample queue application using R-Shiny to easily organize sample receiving, analysis, and backlog for a large water quality monitoring project.  </li>
                <li>Analyzed a large dataset (100k samples) of fluorescence spectroscopy data for drinking water applications using various modeling techniques (e.g., parallel factor analysis, general additive models). </li>
            </ul>
