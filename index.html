        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>After my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, I completed a Master of Applied Science at the University of Toronto focused on quantitative finance and machine learning. Moreover, I completed a four-month internship as a quant researcher at Theme analytics, a startup hedge fund. Given my education and internship experience, I am well versed in programming (Python, R, MATLAB, C), financial mathematics, data science, deep learning, and statistics, and I have shown the capability to take trading hypotheses from signal generation to back testing and into production. As my internship has just been completed, I am actively seeking full time quant research and analyst roles, and I am open to working on both smaller buy side teams as well as larger sell side operations.</p>
